#  here the condition statement is used to check the condition of the code
#  if the condition is true then the code will be executed otherwise it will not be executed
#  if the condition is false then the code will not be executed otherwise it will be executed


# so the condtion statement helps to in the decison making 

# Here is the example 

my_age = int(input("Enter you age: "))
print("My age is", my_age)
if (my_age >= 12):
    print("you age is very young")
else:
    print("you are gettig old")  
    
    
# if elif  and else example

age = int(input("enter your age :"))
if (age >= 18 ):
     print ("you can watct the move")
elif(age < 18):
    print("yo cannot watch the move")
else:
    print("you can watch the move")
